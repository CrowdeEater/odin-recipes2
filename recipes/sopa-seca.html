<h4>This is an excelled authentic Mexican Rice recipe (not to be confused with Spanish rice) that I make as a side dish
     with all of my Mexican dishes. The key is cooking the rice properly and using good quality chicken broth</h4>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1/4 white onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and add rice.</li>
    <li>Cook, stirring constantly, until puffed and golden.</li>
    <li>As rice is beginning to turn golden, stir in the salt and cumin.</li>
    <li>Stir in onions and continue cooking 2 minutes, or until they just begin to soften.</li>
    <li>Add the tomato paste and continue cooking 1 minute, stirring constantly.</li>
    <li>Stir in the chicken broth and bring to a boil</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked. </li>
    <li>Note: The rice may still be wet even though it is fully cooked. If it is wet, remove from heat and replace the lid. Let rice sit for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.</li>
</ol>
