    <h4>There's nothing quite like biting into a heavenly carne asada taco topped with salsa, cilantro, and onions. 
        Carne asada is a delicious dish that originated in Mexico but is now popular around the world. In fact, 
        carne asada is one of the most served dishes at any fiesta or other special event in northern Mexicoâ€”it plays 
        a massive role in the culinary culture there, too. 
    </h4>
    <h5>These days you can find all sorts of Carne Asada seasonings and marinades in your local grocery store. But consider
        trying it <i>al Estilo Ranchero</i> -- as the Ranchers do, grilled over mesquite and seasoned with only sea salt. Sometimes simpler is better.
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Mesquite Wood for grilling</li>
        <li>Steak. Authenticity calls for <em>Diezmillo</em> (thin sliced Chuck steak) </li>
        <li>Sea Salt. Preferably salt from the Sea of Cortez</li>
        <li>Optional: Pineapple or Citrus juice</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Build a fire with Mesquite wood, or Mesquite lump charcoal. The hotter the better.</li>
        <li>Season the steak heavily with salt and grill, turning often, until cooked thru and moderately charred.</li>
        <li>Optional: As the steak is grilling, sprinkle lightly with pineapple or citrus juice.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the grill and rest it a short time. Serve as a steak or diced into pieces in tacos.</li>
    </ol>
